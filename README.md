# LectureLogic

Welcome to LectureLogic

Introduction
  There are a number of systems that are used by schools in order to help control classlife by providing a virtual hub of information that instructors can post to and students can use. LectureLogic is a supplemental or standalone style service that will allow instructors to effectively simulate one lecture at a time as part of a class, and allow students to do work and learn asynchronously especially in a difficult time such as this. 

  This project is an original development that will provide various services that will be related to the activities that take place during an in-person class. The actual instruction will be provided in video format. This will either use an external (youtube or similar) or internal video upload and playing system. For class discussions we will provide a location where questions can be asked about a lecture or the quiz questions, with instructor monitoring, review, and notification options. For in class quizzes or understanding checks, we will have an optional quiz that will be included, with adjustable questions and statistics about both student and all-around results. For attendance, the quiz and view times on the videos will also be available, such that the instructors can view them. 

Project Objectives
  - Build an authentication/user scheme that splits users into either students or instructors and log in with their credentials.
  - Create homepages that differentiate by user type, and provide straightforward information about the available lectures, messages, and statistics that each user needs, as well     as providing specification by class and lecture for this information.
  - Simulate class lectures, discussions, and quizzes, providing a simulated, asynchronous class.
  - Create a messaging system that will allow students to discuss the lecture or class with instructors.
  - Provide a view that allows users to see upcoming lectures and due dates.
  - Provide analytics to users that show relevant information about quizzes and time watched.
